# Bank-Functional-Operations-in-Python

**Project Idea: Mini ATM Simulation**
# Problem Statement
Build a Python program that simulates an ATM machine where a user can:
- Create an account (with name, account number, and PIN).
- Deposit money.
- Withdraw money (with balance check).
- Check balance.
- Exit the system.


 # Concepts Covered
• 	Functions → For deposit, withdraw, balance check, etc.
• 	Loops → To keep the ATM running until the user exits.
• 	OOP → Each account can be represented as an object with attributes (name, account number, PIN, balance).
• 	Python Basics → Input/output, conditionals, error handling.


🚀 Why this project is great
- It feels real-world (everyone uses ATMs).
- Covers all your target concepts.
- Can be extended later (e.g., multiple users, transaction history, file storage).
